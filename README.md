PROJECT1:
Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using machine learning models. The dataset used includes various features such as loan amount, interest rate, term, and borrower characteristics. The following models were trained and evaluated:
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification.
Random Forest: A robust ensemble method offering high accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Achieved perfect accuracy and ROC-AUC score, making it the best-performing model.
The models were evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC, classification reports, and confusion matrices. The final model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities with near-perfect results for predicting loan defaults.

Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and scaling.
Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
Model evaluation with classification metrics.

Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
